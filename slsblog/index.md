### 1. Unit Variations

This form was selected due to the percieved roundness, while the form is actually very angular. The contrast between the faux-rounded edge and the geometric folds creates an interesting piece.

Putting many of these forms together into a modular structure will be difficult because of its fragile structure; the tip of the rounded portion is stuck inside of a little pocket that, without adhesive, is not consistently strong.

</div>

### 2. Modular Structure

Putting together my chosen form was very challenging; due to the cylindrical shape, there were only a few surfaces to paste together. I tried to continue the visual theme of linear, horizontal lines by fitting each form into the void space of the other forms.

<div class="flex rounded shadow" style="margin-top: 120px;">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-2-1.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-2-2.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
</div>
<div class="flex rounded shadow" style="margin-bottom: 120px;">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-2-3.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-2-4.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
</div>

### 3. Translation

For this assignment, I had a couple of goals: to take the three materials and layer them to create a surface that combines all three, to balance the horizontal and vertical shapes, and to have a dynamic focal point that ties it all together.

The flaps that fold upwards work well to further that goal, and the diagonal piece (combined with the rounded piece of vellum) create an intriguing visual from any angle.

<div class="flex rounded shadow" style="margin-top: 120px;">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-3-1.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-3-2.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
</div>
<div class="flex rounded shadow" style="margin-bottom: 120px;">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-3-3.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
	<img style="margin: 12px auto;" src="{{ imagePath }}sls-3-4.jpg" alt="Modular Structure">
</div>

### 4. Transformation

Visualizing a change in material width as significant as this is difficult, so I created a 3D model (to scale) to simplify the process. Following that, I tried to have a good balance between dense and transparent shapes, while at the same time layering the different materials.

<div class="rounded shadow">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-0.jpg" alt="Transformation">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-1.jpg" alt="Transformation">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-2.jpg" alt="Transformation">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-3.jpg" alt="Transformation">
</div>
<div class="flex rounded shadow">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-4.jpg" alt="Transformation">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}sls-4-5.jpg" alt="Transformation">
</div>

### 5. Rethinking the White Cube

For the exhibition, I wanted to find a balance between urban, industrial and natural landscape. The main focal point of the gallery is the large tree in the center of the building. The organic form of the tree branches and leaves contrasted with the metallic, geometric forms of the building and layout. The pedestals and benches are made from geometric, low-poly shapes with a metal plane on top that show the distinct contrast.

The dossier is bound by screws on top to give the book a vertical feeling, mimicking the tree. As a consistent visual element, page numbers are echoed through consistently growing concentric circles on the upper page. The trick to the book is that the format and circles are a nod to the natural aspect of the exhibition, the layout and typography are industrial in their use of space.
