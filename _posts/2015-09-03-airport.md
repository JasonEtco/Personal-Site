>> ## Mandate
>> As a continuation of the [Man and the Machine][1] project, the mandate for this assignment was to create a 30 second promotional video for a specific product regarding the subject of the first assignment; for me, that was the Apple Airport Extreme wireless router. This animation was to be in color, which allowed for a little bit of extra mood.
>
>> ## Project
>> The video uses solid colors and minimal forms to symbolize the sleek, simple designs of Apple products, specifically the Airport Extreme.
