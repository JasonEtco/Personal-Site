>> ## Mandate
>> The mandate for this project was to design a small barrel-fold pamphlet that showed different kinds of folding techniques. We had to include diagrams of each fold, including a flat net; we did not however have to have as much fun as I did illustrating each fold as a paper-vehicle. Please note the interaction between the Accordion Fold, attempting to shoot down the French Fold.

>> ## Project
>> For this project, I wanted to show off some standard folds in a fun and interesting way. After I started with the idea of a paper airplane as a fold, the concept just kept developing on it's own. The most important thing for this project was to create a theme where every page was its own work of art. The purpose of a promotional piece like this is to advertise, as an example, a print shop or bindery's folding capabilities and to show their clients exactly what to ask for.
