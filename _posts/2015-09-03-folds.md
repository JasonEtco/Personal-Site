# Folds on the Fly

For this project, I wanted to show off some standard folds in a fun and interesting way. After I started with the idea of a paper airplane as a fold, the concept just kept developing on it's own. The most important thing for this project was to create a theme where every page was its own work of art. 

The purpose of a promotional piece like this is to advertise, as an example, a print shop or bindery's folding capabilities and to show their clients exactly what to ask for.
