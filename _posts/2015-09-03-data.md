### Mandate
This book was designed for the class Information Design; the goal for this assignment was to explore the proper methods of collecting information and communicating the results in a clear, effective way while still keeping some visual intrigue and appeal.

### Project
Fortunately, the data we were mandated to collect is about ourselves, which means I was able to theme this book closer to my own personal style.
