# Motion Logotype

The idea for this project was to come up with a name and a logo for a fictional company; in this case, a cell service provider. I wanted to highlight the mobility of cell phones, so Motion worked great. The bars where the letter "I" should be hint at the meaning behind the name; without those, it could be attached to any mobile service.
