>> ## Mandate
>> The Montreal United Nations Conference is a new Model UN conference started in 2013 for High School, CEGEP and College students. I was asked to build the branding from the ground up, ensuring the conference's visual identity communicated a feeling of professionalism, which was this conference's main characteristic.  
>
>> ## Project
>> Although they wanted to be seen as a strictly diplomatic conference, many students consider Model UN a chance to socialize and make friends; that created a challenge to find a branding scheme that was clean and simple but still gave the feeling of excited interactions.
