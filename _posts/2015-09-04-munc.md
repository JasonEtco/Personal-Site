### Brief
The Montreal United Nations Conference is a new Model UN conference started in 2013 for High School, CEGEP and College students. I was asked to build the branding from the ground up, ensuring the conference's visual identity communicated a feeling of professionalism which was this conference's main characteristic.

</div>

### The Conference
Although they wanted to be seen as a strictly diplomatic conference, many students consider Model UN a chance to socialize and make friends; that created a challenge to find a branding scheme that was clean and represented professionalism, but still gave the feeling of excited interactions.

### Typography
Among the characteristics of a Model UN conference is clarity of communication. That made typography, especially for nametags and placards, a vital aspect of the design. It was important to keep a professional look and to create a type-palette that was easily legible from a far distance, as dais members (sat at the front of a large auditorium) needed to be able to read names on a placard.

### Collateral
The conference required various brand assets; posters, name tags, a website, guidebooks, placards (papers that delegates hold up to show that they want to speak/vote). MUNC's visual identity needed to be applied to all of these different formats and mediums.
