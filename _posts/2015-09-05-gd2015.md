# Graphic Design Animation

Graphic design is a communicative art that uses different colors, typography, textures, images and shapes to carry over some kind of message; no work of design is purposeless. 

My goal for this assignment was to carry over the mood of what graphic design is to me, rather than to blatantly say it. I explored many of the styles and considerations of the design process and this animation represents the field in an abstract way.
