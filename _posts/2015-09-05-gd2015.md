### Outline
Graphic design is a communicative art that uses different colors, typography, textures, images and shapes to carry over some kind of message; no work of design is purposeless.

### The Plan
My plan was to visually represent what graphic design is, rather than to blatantly say it. I explored many of the styles and considerations of the design process and this animation represents the field in an abstract way.

### Components
The blob and the logotype are the most impactful components of the animation; the typographic qualities of the logo speak to the importance of communication through design, and the blob surrounded by rotating colors reflect what design really is: form combined with an underlying message.
