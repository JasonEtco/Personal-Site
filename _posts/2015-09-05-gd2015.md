>> ## Mandate
>> Graphic design is a communicative art that uses different colors, typography, textures, images and shapes to carry over some kind of message; no work of design is purposeless.
>
>> ## Project
>> My goal for this assignment was to carry over the mood of what graphic design is to me, rather than to blatantly say it. I explored many of the styles and considerations of the design process and this animation represents the field in an abstract way.

	<p>The first few seconds of the animation show a 3D blob, a nod towards one of the exercises a new designer needs to grasp; it teaches the fundamentals of form, negative space and teaches to think a different way.</p>
