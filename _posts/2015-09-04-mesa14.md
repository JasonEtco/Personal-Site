### Mandate
Mesa14 is a top quality Mexican restaurant in downtown Montreal. My mandate was to create a branding system that displayed the quality of the food. Mesa, the Spanish word for table, was the main inspiration for this project; both the word table and the geographical region known as a Mesa. They share a straight linearity that I carried over into the identity for the restaurant.

### Visual Identity
The most important characteristic of the brand is the feeling of straight, linear movement; I used strict horizontal alignments and square graphic elements to communicate that feeling.

</div>

### Alphabet
As a part of the brand, I developed a grid-based alphabet to reinforce the horizontal linearity of the layouts and designs. These letters can be applied to titles for posters, advertisements and other large typographic uses.

	<img src="{{ imagePath }}_alphabet.png" alt="{{ page.title }}">
</div>

### Collateral
To create a complete visual identity, I designed all of the documents and applications that Mesa14 would need. This included a website to make a reservation, a menu for the restaurant and posters to facilitate advertisements.

<div>
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}_mobile.png" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="full-width">
	<img src="{{ imagePath }}_menu.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="shadow rounded">
</div>

	
### Brand Guidelines
As a part of the assignment, we were mandated to design a Brand Guideline book detailing the ways that the visual identity could and should be adapated to various applications.
