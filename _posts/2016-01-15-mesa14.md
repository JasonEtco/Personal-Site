>> ## Mandate
>> Mesa14 is a top quality Mexican restaurant in downtown Montreal. My mandate was to create a branding system that displayed the quality of the food. Mesa, the Spanish word for table, was the main inspiration for this project; both the word table and the geographical region known as a Mesa. They share a straight linearity that I carried over into the identity for the restaurant. 
>
>> ## Project
>> The brand consists of the logo, a website where users can set a reservation, and other printed material like a brand guideline book. The book contains detailed descriptions on how the brand should adapt and apply to different material like photography or text based content.
