>> ## Mandate
>> For my class "Technical Production for Print," I created a limited edition boxed set documenting two type foundries, a European and an American. We had to take printing costs under consideration, which limited our abilities to explore die-cuts, offset printing and other finishing methods. 
>
>> ## Project
>> The box itself is made out of both wood and paper; one outer box and 2 inner paper boxes, each containing a CD, a booklet and a set of cards with different typefaces created by the foundry including a description of the typeface.
