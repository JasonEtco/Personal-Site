>> ## Mandate
>> The mandate for this project was to create 4 different logotypes based on a the words in a category of my choosing. Ostrich, Penguin, Magpie and Flamingo were from the Bird category. The purpose of this assignment was to explore methods to visually communicate the characteristics of each word, and to be able to immediately understand the concept for the logotype. For that, simplicity and clarity were imperative.
