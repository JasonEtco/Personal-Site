# E3 Website

E3 is a computer and video game trade show held annually in Los Angeles, California. The name, E3, stands for “Electronic Entertainment Expo”. Being the largest technology-themed convention in North America, E3 hosts major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sony and a number of high profile video game developers like EA Games and Nintendo.

I wanted the website to communicate how dynamic the event is, so I used a lot of busy photographs to show the exciting nature of the convention. I included strong photography near a lot of negative space to balance out the page, so that the photography is strong but not confusing.
