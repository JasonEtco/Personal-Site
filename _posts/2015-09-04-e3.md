### The Problem
E3 is a computer and video game trade show held annually in Los Angeles, California. The name, E3, stands for “Electronic Entertainment Expo”. E3 hosts major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sony and a number of high profile video game developers like EA Games and Nintendo. Their website and brand didn't properly reflect the event, so I remade them.

<div>
	<img src="/assets/case-studies/{{ page.shortname }}/{{ page.shortname }}_logo-dev.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
</div>

### Brand Attitude (Branditude)
The website needed to communicate the dynamic nature of the event, so busy photography was an important asset in showing the exciting event. This created a challenge of the photography overpowering some of the other important elements, which was solved by balancing out the page with appropriate use of negative space.

<div>
	<img src="/assets/case-studies/{{ page.shortname }}/{{ page.shortname }}_home.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="shadow rounded">
	<img src="/assets/case-studies/{{ page.shortname }}/{{ page.shortname }}_options.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}">
</div>

### Secondary Pages
The assignment was to design and code only 4 pages of the site. The challenge was of course to keep the same visual style throughout each page while highlighting its purpose. 

<div class="flex">
	<img src="/assets/case-studies/{{ page.shortname }}/{{ page.shortname }}_page-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="shadow rounded">
	<img src="/assets/case-studies/{{ page.shortname }}/{{ page.shortname }}_page-2.jpg" alt="{{ page.title }}" class="shadow rounded">
</div>

### Responsive Development
Despite the fact that the assignment did not require the site to be responsive, as a 21st Century website I felt it was necessary to expand the design to fit all devices and screen sizes.
