>> ## Mandate
>> Poster design for my class "Explorations in Visual Communication." My assignment was to create a poster for the artist Brian Eno, which promotes his recent composition "Small Craft on a Milk Sea." The music is abstract and repetitive and the rough elements in the design reflect the mood of the music.
