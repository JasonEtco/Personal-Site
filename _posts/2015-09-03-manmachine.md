# Man & the Machine Animation

The objective of this assignment was to create a logo and a 10 second animation based on the phrase "Man and the Machine," and a chosen machine or invention. Other than that, the project was very open to interpretation. I chose to use a WiFi router. 

WiFi routers are used in almost every house, business and university to provide wireless access to the internet. It takes information from a modem, which is plugged into the phone lines and fed information directly from the ownerâ€™s Internet Service Provider (ISP), and transmits that information over a wireless network.
