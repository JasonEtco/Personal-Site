### The App
Spently is an app on the Shopify App Store that helps online business owners create email templates that go out to their customers once they've performed a specific action. Like when you order something online, you'll receive an Order Confirmation email.

<div>
	<img style="margin: 60px auto" src="{{ imagePath }}_stars.png" alt="{{ page.title }}">
</div>

### The Old
I started working at Spently at the beginning of May 2016; the design wasn't consistent, the front-end code was chaotic and error-prone and the build processes weren't helping. Here's what the in-app UI looked like.

### The New
It didn't make sense for me to try to improve the CSS architecture of the app; it was too all-over-the-place. Instead, I rewrote all of the CSS and JS from scratch using SCSS, and ensuring scalability with DRY and BEM principles.

Using Gulp as a task runner, I was able to write clean, cross-browser compatible code that took the site from a footprint of over 2mb to just 80kb (and that's just the compiled CSS).
