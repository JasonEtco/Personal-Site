	<h2 class="contact__sub-title scene-element scene-element--fade-in-down">My name is Jason.</h2>

	<p class="contact__sub-desc scene-element scene-element--fade-in-down">I don't just learn, I obsess. When I taught myself to use the Adobe Suite products, that was all I thought about. I built nine different websites just to learn the fundamentals of Front-End Dev, just to learn by doing.
	<br/><br/>
	When I can combine my technical obsessions with my design background, I can produce great results. I'm not an artist, I'm a visual problem solver and I love to learn to solve more problems.</p>

	<h1 class="contact__title scene-element scene-element--fade-in-down">Talk to me.</h1>

	<p class="contact__desc scene-element scene-element--fade-in-down">I'm a Designer and Developer based in downtown <strong>Toronto</strong>. If you have an interesting project, I'd love to hear about it! I am currently looking for part-time and summer work.</p>
