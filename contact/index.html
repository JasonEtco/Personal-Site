	<p class="contact__desc scene-element scene-element--fade-in-down">I don't just learn, I obsess. When I taught myself to use the Adobe Suite products, that was all I thought about. I built nine different websites just to learn the fundamentals of Front-End Dev, just to learn by doing.
	<br/><br/>
	When I can combine my technical obsessions with my design background, I can produce great results. I'm not an artist, I'm a visual problem solver and I love to learn to solve more problems.</p>
